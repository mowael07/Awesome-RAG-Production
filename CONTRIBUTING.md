# Contributing to Awesome RAG Production

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! It is people like you who make this list a valuable resource for the AI engineering community.

## 🛠️ Quality Standards

We don't just collect links; we curate **engineering excellence**. To be accepted, a resource must meet the following criteria:

1.  **Production Focus:** Does it solve a real-world problem like scalability, latency, or reliability?
2.  **Activity:** Is the project maintained? We generally don't accept repositories that haven't been updated in the last 6 months.
3.  **Documentation:** Does it have a clear README, API reference, or case study?
4.  **No "Marketing Only" Links:** We prefer open-source tools or transparent technical blog posts over pure marketing fluff.
