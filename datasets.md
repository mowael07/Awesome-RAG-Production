## 🏅 The Leaderboards

Before choosing a model, check these live leaderboards:
- **[MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)** - The gold standard for choosing an embedding model (Retrieval, Clustering, Reranking quality).
- **[Open Compass](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-llm)** - Comprehensive LLM evaluation which includes retrieving capabilities.
- **[Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)** - General LLM performance.
