## 🧱 Reference Architectures

Stop guessing. Here are three battle-tested stacks for different stages of
maturity.

### 1. The Local / Dev Stack (Zero to One)

**Goal:** Rapid prototyping, zero cost, no API keys.

**Stack:**

- **LLM:** **Ollama** (LLaMA 3 / Mistral)
- **Vector DB:** **Chroma** (Embedded)
- **Eval:** **Ragas** (Basic checks)

**Why:** Runs entirely on your laptop. Perfect for "Hello World" and checking
feasibility.

**Risks:** High latency; performance depends on your hardware; no horizontal
scaling.

**Observability Checklist:** `print()` statements and basic logging.

### 2. The Mid-Scale / Production Stack (Speed to Market)

**Goal:** High precision, developer velocity, minimal infra management.

**Stack:**

- **Vector DB:** **Qdrant** or **Weaviate** (Cloud/Managed)
- **Reranker:** **Cohere Rerank** (API)
- **Tracing:** **Langfuse** or **Arize Phoenix**

**Why:** Offloads complexity to managed services. "It just works" with great documentation.

**Risks:** Costs scale linearly with usage; dependency on external APIs (Vendor
lock-in).

**Observability Checklist:** Latency tracking, Token usage costs, Trace
visualization.

### 3. The Enterprise / High-Scale Stack (The 1%)

**Goal:** Throughput maximization, data sovereignty, full control.

**Stack:**

- **Vector DB:** **Milvus** (Distributed)
- **Serving:** **vLLM** (Self-hosted)
- **Eval (CI/CD):** **DeepEval**
- **Monitoring:** **OpenLIT** (OpenTelemetry)

**Why:** You own the data and the compute. Scales to billions of vectors.

**Risks:** Significant operational complexity (Kubernetes); requires a dedicated Platform Engineering team.

**Observability Checklist:** Distributed tracing, Embedding drift detection, Custom SLA alerts, GPU utilization metrics.

## 🔍 Retrieval & Reranking

**Hybrid Search:**
A retrieval strategy that linearly combines Dense Vector Search (semantic
understanding) with Sparse Keyword Search (BM25 for exact term matching). This
mitigates the "lost in the middle" phenomenon and significantly improves
zero-shot retrieval performance.

- [BGE-Reranker](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3)
  - One of the best open-source rerankers available. It is a cross-encoder model
    trained to output a relevance score for query-document pairs, offering
    commercial-grade performance for self-hosted pipelines.
- [Cohere Rerank](https://cohere.com/rerank)
  - A powerful API-based reranking model. By re-scoring the initial top-K
    documents from a cheaper/faster retriever, it drastically improves precision
    (often boosting MRR by 10-20%) with minimal code changes.
- [FlashRank](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/FlashRank)
  - A lightweight, serverless-friendly reranking library. It runs quantized
    cross-encoder models directly in the CPU (no Torch/GPU required), making it
    ideal for edge deployments or cost-sensitive architectures.
- [RAGatouille](https://github.com/bclavie/RAGatouille)
  - A library that makes ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT)
    easy to use. ColBERT offers fine-grained token-level matching, providing
    superior retrieval quality compared to standard single-vector dense
    retrieval.

**GraphRAG:**
An advanced retrieval method that constructs a knowledge graph from documents. It
traverses relationships between entities to answer "global" queries (e.g., "What
are the main themes?") that standard vector search struggles to address.

## 📊 Evaluation & Benchmarking

Reliable RAG requires measuring the **RAG Triad**: Context Relevance,
Groundedness, and Answer Relevance.

- [Ares](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ARES)
  - An automated evaluation system that helps you evaluate RAG systems with fewer
    human labels. It uses prediction-powered inference to provide statistical
    confidence intervals for your system's performance.
- [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/)
  - An enterprise-grade platform for evaluating and logging LLM outputs. It
    excels at "Online Evaluation," allowing you to score real-world user
    interactions and feed that data back into your development set.
- [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)
  - The "Pytest for LLMs". It offers a unit-testing framework for RAG,
    integrating seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines to catch regression in retrieval
    quality or hallucination rates before deployment.
- [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)
  - A framework that uses an "LLM-as-a-Judge" to evaluate your pipeline. It
    calculates metrics like Faithfulness (did the answer come from the context?)
    and Answer Relevancy without needing human-labeled ground truth.

## 👁️ Observability & Tracing

- [Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix)
  - A tool specifically designed for troubleshooting retrieval issues. It
    visualizes your embedding clusters and retrieved document rankings, helping
    you understand *why* the model retrieved irrelevant context.
- [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)
  - An open-source engineering platform for LLM observability. It captures full
    execution traces (latency, token usage, cost) and allows for "Prompt
    Management," letting you version-control prompts decoupled from your code.
- [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)
  - Built by the LangChain team, this is the gold standard for debugging complex
    chains. It provides a "Playground" to rerun specific traces with modified
    prompts to iterate on edge cases instantly.
- [OpenLIT](https://github.com/openlit/openlit)
  - An OpenTelemetry-native monitoring solution. If you already use
    Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog, OpenLIT drops into your existing stack to
    provide standardized LLM metrics (GPU usage, token throughput).

## 🚀 Deployment & Serving

- [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
  - A framework for packaging models into standardized APIs (Bentos). It handles
    the complexity of adaptive batching and multi-model serving, allowing you to
    deploy any model to any cloud (AWS Lambda, EC2, Kubernetes) with one
    command.
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
  - The easiest way to run LLMs locally. While primarily for dev/local use, it
    bridges the gap between local testing and deployment by providing a standard
    API for models like LLaMA 3, Mistral, and Gemma.
- [Ray Serve](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)
  - The industry standard for scaling Python ML workloads. It allows you to
    compose complex pipelines (e.g., Retriever + Reranker + LLM) where each
    component scales independently across a cluster of machines.
- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
  - A high-performance inference engine known for PagedAttention. It maximizes
    GPU memory utilization, allowing you to serve larger models or handle higher
    concurrency with lower latency than standard Hugging Face Transformers.

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

- [Lakera Guard](https://www.lakera.ai/)
