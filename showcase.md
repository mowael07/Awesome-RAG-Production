# 🏆 RAG in Production: Operations & Case Studies

Theory is great, but production is where the rubber meets the road. This section
curates deep-dive engineering blogs, whitepapers, and talks from companies
running Retrieval-Augmented Generation at scale.

> **Criteria:** We only include resources that discuss *architecture, latency,
> evaluation, or scaling challenges*. No marketing fluff.
